## Introduction üìñ

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as positive üòÑ, negative üò†, or neutral üòê. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model that has achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. We'll fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model using an Arabic reviews dataset to build a powerful sentiment classifier for this specific domain.

## Project Structure üìÇ

The project is organized as follows:

* **Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis.ipynb:** Google Colab Notebook containing the main code and explanations for fine-tuning BERT on Arabic reviews.
* **ar_reviews_100k.tsv:** Dataset containing 100k Arabic reviews for sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Mixed).
* **README.md:** This file.

## Getting Started üèÅ

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook:** Open the `Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. **Enable GPU:** For faster training, it is highly recommended to enable GPU acceleration in Colab. Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries using the provided code cells in the notebook (`transformers`, `ktrain`, `tensorflow`).
4. **Mount Google Drive:** Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset (`ar_reviews_100k.tsv`) stored in your Drive.
5. **Run the Code:** Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to understand the steps involved in fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis on Arabic reviews.
   - This includes loading the dataset, preprocessing, training, validating, and saving the fine-tuned model.
6. **Explore the Dataset:** Examine the `ar_reviews_100k.tsv` file to understand the data used for sentiment analysis.
   - This dataset contains 100,000 Arabic reviews labeled with sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, or Mixed.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Fine-tuning BERT:** This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model, specifically adapting it for sentiment analysis in Arabic.
* **Arabic Sentiment Analysis:** We'll leverage a large dataset of Arabic reviews to train a custom sentiment classifier.
* **Google Colab Integration:** The project is designed to be run seamlessly within Google Colab, taking advantage of its GPU capabilities.
* **Step-by-Step Guide:** The Google Colab Notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the process, making it accessible for beginners.
* **Evaluation and Saving:** We'll evaluate the model's performance and save the fine-tuned model for later use.

## Conclusion üéâ
