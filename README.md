# Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis: Arabic Reviews 🚀

This project provides a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis on Arabic reviews using Google Colab. We'll leverage the power of BERT and Google Colab's GPU capabilities to build a custom sentiment classifier, specifically tailored for Arabic text.

## Introduction 📖

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as positive 😄, negative 😠, or neutral 😐. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model that has achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. We'll fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model using an Arabic reviews dataset to build a powerful sentiment classifier for this specific domain.

### What’s the Task?  
We’re working with the **[Arabic 100k Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abedkhooli/arabic-100k-reviews)** dataset—a compilation of 100k (well, 99,999) Arabic reviews from hotels, books, movies, products, and airlines. Each review falls into one of three sentiment categories:  
1️⃣ **Positive** 🌟  
2️⃣ **Negative** 😠  
3️⃣ **Mixed** 🤔  

### 📂 **About the Dataset**:  
- **Content**: Each review includes a sentiment label (`Positive`, `Negative`, or `Mixed`) and the review text, **separated by tabs** (TSV format).  
- **Processing**: Reviews were cleaned of diacritics and non-Arabic characters, ensuring high-quality data.  
- **Balanced Classes**: No duplicate reviews, making it a robust dataset for classification tasks.  

### Why Fine-Tune BERT?  
BERT has a deep contextual understanding of text, but by fine-tuning it with our dataset, we’ll train it to recognize sentiment in Arabic reviews with precision.  

### What to Expect?  
1️⃣ **Load and explore the dataset** to understand what we’re working with.  
2️⃣ **Prepare BERT for sentiment analysis**.  
3️⃣ **Train and evaluate** our custom sentiment classifier.  

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized as follows:

* **Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis.ipynb:** Google Colab Notebook containing the main code and explanations for fine-tuning BERT on Arabic reviews.
* **ar_reviews_100k.tsv:** Dataset containing 100k Arabic reviews for sentiment analysis (Positive, Negative, Mixed).
* **README.md:** This file.

## Getting Started 🏁

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook:** Open the `Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. **Enable GPU:** For faster training, it is highly recommended to enable GPU acceleration in Colab. Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries using the provided code cells in the notebook (`transformers`, `ktrain`, `tensorflow`).
4. **Mount Google Drive:** Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset (`ar_reviews_100k.tsv`) stored in your Drive.
5. **Run the Code:** Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to understand the steps involved in fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis on Arabic reviews.
   - This includes loading the dataset, preprocessing, training, validating, and saving the fine-tuned model.
6. **Explore the Dataset:** Examine the `ar_reviews_100k.tsv` file to understand the data used for sentiment analysis.
   - This dataset contains 100,000 Arabic reviews labeled with sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, or Mixed.

## Key Features ✨
